//Abstract classes can have implemetations for some of the methods , where as interfaces cannot have any implementations
//interface cannot contain fields , e.g int age where as abstract class can contain
//Interface can only inherit from other interfaces , but abstract class can inherit from other interfaces as well as abstract classes
//Interfaces are public by default and don't require an access modifier where as abstract classes are private by default and need an access modifier
//Both cannot be instantiated, can only be inherited
//class does not support multiple class inheritance(abstract or other) where as it supports multiple interface inheritance
